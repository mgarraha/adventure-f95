=============

Port of Colossal Cave Adventure (Crowther and Woods, mid 1970s) to modern Fortran

The initial code is from http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/adv350-pdp10.tar.gz
The PDP-10 was a DEC machine with 36-bit words and a legacy dialect of Fortran.
It appears to treat strings of 5 7-bit characters the same as 36-bit integers.

My goal is to remain faithful to the original design while transforming the coding style
to a more modern idiom.
